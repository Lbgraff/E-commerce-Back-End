# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

My motivation to create this project was to gain experience with object-relational mapping. I learned about how seeds, models, and routes interact as well as how to test routes in Insomnia. This project solves the problem of entering, modifying, and deleting information regarding an e-commerce application.

## Installation

To start the application, the user will sign into their PostgreSQL account. Then, they will create the schema. They will run the seeds, and finally they will run the application with "npm start".

## Usage

Image1 shows a GET route for all categories.

Image2 shows a DELETE route for deleting a product by ID.

## Credits

I referred to the class activities for examples.
